# Ossining School Site (scaffold)

Minimal React + Vite + TypeScript scaffold for the Ossining School Tools project.

Run locally:

```bash
cd ossining-school-site
npm install
npm run dev
```

What this scaffold includes:
- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Small API client stubs for fdmealplanner and the Google Apps Script day API
- Basic `App.tsx` placeholder and styles

Next steps:
- Implement the setup page and child profile routing
- Implement serverless proxy for fdmealplanner if CORS blocks direct calls
- Add profile encoding/sharing and caching
- Add tests and CI
